# Advent of Code 2024

This is my attempt to do [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) - in Nix!

The main objective is to explore Nix's capabilities as a general-purpose functional programming language, something it was certainly not designed for.

Thanks to Grimmauld for inspiring and motivating me to do this. You can check out his attempt at doing this [here](https://git.grimmauld.de/Grimmauld/Advent-of-Nix-2024).
